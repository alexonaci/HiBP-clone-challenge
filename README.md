Have I been PWNED lets you check if you have an account that has been compromised in a data breach

## Requirements


Using the HiBP API : https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2 , create a SPA in vanilla JS having the following functionalities:

- search for breaches and display them (with pagination and total number)
  + if nothing was searched for, the default page should display all the breaches
- search by account or email and display if your account was compromised in any breach. List them in the same way like in the previous view
- add a detailed view for the breach where you display the following data:
  + description
  + breach date
  + image
  + compromised data
  + compromised accounts
  + date added to HiBP
- the detailed view must contain a breadcrumb which, by clicking on the parent (Breaches or Accounts), it must redirect you to the search page where it must have the same state as before clicking.
- it should be a Single Page Application, so don't change the html file and don't add any ;) use only JS to generate the pages
- make the UI components as reusable as possible 
- don't use any external library or package
- have a look on this list and try to respect it as much as you see it fits your situation ;) : https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript ( url to the book: https://www.investigatii.md/uploads/resurse/Clean_Code.pdf )

Bonus points if you make the pagination dynamic, with adjacents like in the first example on this page:

## Use postman to test the API:
